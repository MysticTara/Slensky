Slensky the Discord bot that moderate your server. With such features like: security, automod, welcome system, music system, and more.

The source code here is provided for educational purposes. I would recommend against running your own instance of this bot. Instead, use `p!invite` and [click the link](https://dsc.gg/slensky-invite) to add the bot to your server.

## Hosting

The most problems are where i can host it! To run the bot use vsc and to host use hosting service like heruko, or if you wanna use our hosting server join support server. 
Running on replit? If you are running on replit or gltich don't forget to put code (.env). You can host in uptimerbot to host it.

## üîó installations

You need to install - ``npm install clx@cluster``
And - ``npm bs@api``
And run on ``node .``

## üì• Cluster clx Guide

Cluster clx is private database powerd by Slensky team.
**How to get?**
- To get there is to way the first way is:
‚Ä¢ Join support server and open a Ticket.
- Second way
‚Ä¢ Open repo called Slensky Cluster on our homepage or search it in on our profile, after you opens run the code and it will ask a name for the database, put a name then you will get the id and api

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions. Please, however, make an issue first if you want to contribute to the bot.

Right now, the code's still quite convoluted. I am working on refactoring and reorganizing the project.

I'm looking to add the following major features to the bot, in addition to QoL fixes and small updates:

- Automod
	- Server logs
	- anti-self bot
	- anti-not verified bots
